Hello, I’m @rafeh-rehan. My background is in Astronomy & Physics, which is where I was first introduced to programming.
My main language is Python, but I know a little FORTRAN.

I’m interested in applying machine learning techniques to data analysis and modelling.
I’m currently learning how to apply machine learning techniques to answer questions in theoretical particle physics. 

You can reach me at rafeh.rehan1@gmail.com :)
