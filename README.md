Hello, I’m Rafeh. My background is in Astronomy & Physics, which is where I was first introduced to programming.
My main language is Python, but I know a little FORTRAN.

I’m interested in learning how to apply machine learning techniques to data analysis and modelling.

You can reach me at rafeh.rehan1@gmail.com, constructive criticism is welcome!
