Hello, Iâ€™m Rafeh. I did my undergrad in Astronomy & Physics at the University of Toronto, and I am currently at the University of Guelph doing a masters in Condensed Matter (2D systems).
My main language is Python, but I know some FORTRAN, JavaScript, and C++. I mainly upload numerical simulations of physical phenomena, and post all of my projects for people who want to play around with physics simulations.

You can reach me at rafeh.rehan1@gmail.com, constructive criticism is welcome!
